                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>I was born in Middletown, CT. From a young age I was into sports and learning. I took my first
                    computer science class in
                    high school and decided to major in computer science in college. I taught myself how to code
                    websites with HTML and CSS
                    and from there learned many other technologies, languages, and frameworks.</p>
                <p>I loved to code so much that I started this blog website dedicated
                    to it. This site, along with my personal website, is constantly evolving as I learn more skills
                    or think of a cool new design to implement.
                </p>
